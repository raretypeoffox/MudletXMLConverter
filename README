MUDLET XML Converter

A Mudlet script to help Mudlet package developers.

Intention of the script is to unpack Mudlet packages into their .lua and .json components to allow
developers to edit their packages in their preferred development editor of choice (eg VS Code).

Currently functional:
- Unpacking a Mudlet .xml package into its component parts

Future Implementation
- Repack the .lua and .json files into a single Mudlet .xml file

Current Usage:

python main.py
